# Regression
Predicting the amount of CO2 emitted from cars.


CO2 emissions have significant environmental impacts. The accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere contributes to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat and causing global warming. This leads to various adverse effects, including rising global temperatures, sea-level rise, changes in weather patterns, and ecosystem disruptions. The long-term consequences of climate change can negatively impact human health, agriculture, biodiversity, and socioeconomic systems.

Therefore, reducing CO2 emissions is crucial for mitigating climate change and minimizing its harmful effects on the environment and human well-being. This involves transitioning to cleaner and renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, adopting sustainable practices, and promoting conservation efforts.

The dataset has the details of several vehicles and the CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer. A machine learning model like Regression can be helpful in predicting the amount of CO2 emitted. With the help of this regression model, the amount of Carbon dioxide to be emitted by future cars can be predicted with the help of various attributes of the car.
